So for my final year project I made a heart disease prediction model with a website/host service.
My Project is a heart disease prediction using machine learning. 
The project can be for any person of any age as heart disease can affect anyone of any age. It predicts if a person has any sign of heart disease based on the data entered. 
The problem It addresses is it a quick simple way to check if a person is suffering. 
The project aspires to build a robust, interpretable, and deployable machine learning model for heart disease prediction, contributing to advancements in healthcare practices and promoting early intervention for better patient care.
The motivation behind undertaking this project stems from the alarming rise in cardiovascular diseases globally and in the business and workplace. 
By harnessing the power of machine learning, I aim to create a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention efforts. 
The project aligns with the overarching goal of improving public health by leveraging technology to address critical medical challenges<img
